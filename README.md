# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to help Bobby determine how many employees are retiring and which of the of those employees are eligible for a mentorship program. This analysis is important because it will help the company guide their strategy on how to fill the positions and also who through the mentorship program is able to help this transition for the retirees and the company.

## Results
- The titles with the highest number of employees that are about to retire are Senior Engineers and Senior Staff. This means that there will be more senior leaders elligible for the mentorship program than other titles. Also, from a business perspective, this can potentially create a large gap in senior experience in the firm and may need to prepare a back-fill or promotion strategy to fill the spots of the impending retirees.

- There are 1,549 disctint employees that are elligible for the mentorship program - out of the 72,548 total impending retirees, that only makes up 2.14%.

- As predicted, a majortiy of the elligible mentors are seniors but there are none in the manager category.

- There are about 46 retirees for every 1 elligible mentor. The company may need to expand the mentorship program in order to better support the sheer number of retirees. I recommend opening up the elligibility by one additional year to those born in 1964 so that there are more mentors, but also mentor support is extended for an additional year providing extra support for retirees - this may take some resource stress off the company by being prepared more in advance.


## Summary
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
- At the end of the year, 72,548 roles will need to be filled and most likely will be filled on a rolling basis as people retire (they all won't retire at the same time). Below is the aggregate salaries per title of all retirees. This is a very large sum of money that can be budgeted back into resources to help fill the positions and support the trainings for those that did fill the positions.
