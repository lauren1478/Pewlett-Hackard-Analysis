# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

#### Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this analysis was to help Bobby determine how many employees are retiring and which of the of those employees are eligible for a mentorship program. 

#### Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
- The titles with the highest number of employees that are about to retire are Senior Engineers and Senior Staff. This means that there will be more senior leaders elligible for the mentorship program than other titles. Also, from a business perspective, this can potentially create a large gap in senior experience in the firm and may need to prepare a back-fill or promotion strategy to fill the spots of the impending retirees.

- There are 1,549 disctint employees that are elligible for the mentorship program - out of the 72,548 total impending retirees, that only makes up 2.14%.

## Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
- At the end of the year, 72,548 roles will need to be filled and most likely will be filled on a rolling basis as people retire (they all won't retire at the same time). Below is the aggregate salaries per title of all retirees. This is a very large sum of money that can be budgeted back into resources to help fill the positions and support the trainings for those that did fill the positions.

Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
- There are not enough mentors for how many impending retirees there will be. There are about 46 retirees for every 1 elligible mentor.
